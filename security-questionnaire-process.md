# Handling Customer Security Questionnarires

## 1. Overview
A security questionnaire sent from a client to a vendor or an organization, helps the client understand the security and compliance policies the organization aligns with and follows in their practices. 

## Proposed process for Linq to follow

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- _Categorize_ the questionnaire into a checklist or a lengthy form.
- _Prioritize_ the questionnaire based on the customer and the deadline they have provided. The priority levels should be in the order of: low, medium and high.
- Read the questionnaire carefully as different companies follow a different _style_ based on their industry or their company's goals.

### Step 2: Team Involvement
- _Subject Matter experts (SMEs)_ need to be involved to make sure we are answering the questionnaire with the appropriate information and not overloading the client with unnecessary information.
- _Security and Compliance_ team should are needed to provide technical details and helping us make sure that the answers are compliant with the regulatory requirements.
- To understand the customer's needs, we need the _Sales_ team to look at the answers.
- For reviewing contractual obligations related to the questionnaire, the _Legal_ team should be closely involved.

### Step 3: Information Gathering
- Usually, questionnaires have a lot of common ground to cover. Clients generally want to know about the incident response, data protection rules and privacy policies. We need to have a checklist for all of these _common topics_. Also, we should be able to provide quick securely accessible data and documentation.
- Gathering informaiton from the _company's security policies and compliance certifications_ is also a good way to make sure that our responses to the questionnaire are to the point.
- We can use tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Trello to communicate and take inputs from all the people involved.

### Step 4: Penning Responses
- Now that we have all the people and the information we need, we can start writing responses based on the _context_ of the customer.
- We should create _templates_ for frequently asked questions (FAQs) and use those whenever possible, to save time. Although, it is efficient to use templates we need to keep the answers unique to each questionnaire's style.

### Step 5: Analysis and Approval
- Assign a _senior member_ of the Security and Compliance team to review the responses. The reviewer should be added to the collaboration meetings or groups, so they can communicate with the team involved with answering the questionnaire. 
- Get _feedback_ from everyone involved to make sure that the responses are accurate and compliant.

### Step 6: Submission
- Check that the file is _formatted_ and all the required documentation is attached. 
- Once everything is analysed and approved by the team involved, we can _submit_ the responses to the questionnaire through the customer's portal or email or any other method approved by the customer.
- After submitting, it is good to _follow up_ with the client to make sure they have received it and make sure to alleviate any concerns that they might have.

### Suggested Tools and Automation 
- **_Document Management_** tools like Google Drive, Share Point or GitHub to help us collaborate and keep track of versions.
- **_Project Management_** tools like Trello, Asana can help us keep track of the status of the questionnaire.
- **_Automation_** integrations like Zapier help us automate reminders,  gives notifications for deadlines and allows us to customize our own automations.

### Conclusion
Sticking to an organized yet adaptable process for answering customer security questionnaires is resourceful like a playbook during a security attack. It is important to note that we need to take feedback from the team and schedule reviews regularly to help us remove issues and improving our responses to the questionnaires.
