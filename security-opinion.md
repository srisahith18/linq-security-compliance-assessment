# Strong Opinion in Security and Compliance
**My Opinion:** When handling confidential information, I believe that we should use the best security equipment and security practices. I know that it will not completely prevent all attacks but it will significantly prevent or reduce the number of attacks and the damage that can be caused.

## Reasons 
### Improving Threat Landscape
Cybercriminals are using advanced techniques to attack organizations that have outdated and quite frankly vulnerable systems. Even a small organization can be prey to these kinds of threat actors. By investing in latest security technologies like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), and NGFWs (Next-Generation Firewalls) we can defend our organizations better and ensure the integrity of our data. 

### Trust and Image
Trust in our current digital landscape is quite important. One single attack on an organization's systems that lead to a breach, can bring down the image of that organization. By prioritizing and investing in high-end equipment can help an organization showcase their _adherence to security_ practices and help improve their customer's trust and loyalty.

### Compliance
With such widespread digital technology everywhere, the number of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, organizations are required to show that they are compliant. Non-compliance can cause the clients involved to lose trust and will affect the value of the organization in the market. Therefore, following the best practices available will help the organization gain a _competitive edge_ in the market and puts them as a leader in compliance. 

### Cost of Breach
One popular example to prove my point is the Equifax breach which impacted more than 147 million customers. The company failed to **patch a vulnerability** that had been available for more than 6 months before the attack. This particular breach gave the cybercriminals names, dates of birth, SSN, driver's license numbers, and credit card numbers of all the 147 million people. Consequently, Equifax was fined $700 million since the breach contained Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This situation would have been avoided, if they just used the latest available security patch. 

### Conclusion
While the initial investment on security equipment might be higher and keeping up-to-date on security practices might seem tedious, in the long-term we can avoid a lot of issues. Data is the most valuable thing in the world right now, and keeping it safe is our utmost priority.
